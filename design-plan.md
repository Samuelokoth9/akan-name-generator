Design Plan: Akan Name Generator

1. Overview
   The Akan Name Generator is a web application that calculates the day of the week a user was born and assigns them an Akan name based on their gender. Akan names are derived from Ghanaian culture, where children are named according to the day of the week they were born.

2. Objectives

- Collect user input: birthdate (day, month, year) and gender
- Validate the input to ensure correctness
- Calculate the day of the week from the birthdate
- Assign the corresponding Akan name based on the day and gender
- Display the result to the user
- Ensure the application is user-friendly and responsive

3. Technologies Used

- HTML5: Structure of the webpage
- CSS3: Styling and layout
- JavaScript (ES6): Logic for input handling, validation, and name generation

4. User Interface Design
   . Layout

- A centered container with a title and description
- A form with input fields for day, month, year, and gender selection
- A submit button to generate the Akan name
- A section to display the result
  . Accessibility
- Labels associated with each input field
- Clear instructions and placeholders
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

5. Functional Requirements
   . Input Validation

- Day: Must be between 1 and 31
- Month: Must be between 1 and 12
- Year: Must be a positive integer

. Akan Name Assignment

- Arrays containing Akan names for each day of the week for both genders
- Map the calculated day to the corresponding name

. Result Display

- Show the assigned Akan name in a designated result section
- Clear previous results upon new submissions

6. Non-Functional Requirements

- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices
- Clean and intuitive user interface
- Fast load times and efficient performance

7. Future Enhancements

- Add localization for different languages
- Integrate a date picker for easier date selection
- Store user data for personalized experiences
- Implement animations for result display

8. Conclusion
   This design plan outlines the structure and requirements for the Akan Name Generator project. By following this plan, the application will provide users with an accurate and culturally informative experience in determining their Akan names.
